`Nine Sols was fantastic! I've been itching for more Hollow Knight, 
and this was an extremely solid more of that. The balance was a bit off, 
most exploration wasn't ever difficult and then a couple bosses, especially 
the final boss were way way more challenging. But I loved the story! Nothing 
special, but well done and a neat combination of spaceships and traditional chinese 
storytelling.`

`This is the smaller worse games made with fewer people that we need in the world.
And its also really good. A perfect distillation of chat room and animal crossing 
fishing minigame with secrets and delightful surprises. Played this a few times with 
some friends, and a few times solo and it works both ways, but definitely shines as 
a lil community thing.`

`I set up a lovely weekly friend hangout centered around satisfactory.
I think this one does a good factory game, but the balance causes it to scale out 
a little too hard midgame. I would not enjoy the pacing playing solo for sure. Trains 
are great, but the tracks are way too wiggly.`

the classic factory game for the new space age dlc. I've just barely gotten to space,
and haven't gone too much further than that yet, got carried away with trains a bit 
again.`

sometimes hit or miss, but there are a couple real gems in there. I think I played the submarine game
for like 6 hours straight and 100%'d it.`
